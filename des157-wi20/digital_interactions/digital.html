    <img id="myImg" src="gongcha.png" alt="Gong Cha, overall, has a lot of interesting Asian inspired Milk Tea and brewed Tea flavors. 
                                       It is a must try if there is one in your area. I highly recommend trying their Wintermelon Teas." style="width:100%;max-width:300px">
    <img id="myImg2" src="sharetea.png" alt="ShareTea is super location dependent since the quality and environment changes with each location. 
                                        The ShareTea in Davis has not been doing so well do to the construction projects that have occurred within the past 2 years; the projects killed the business.
                                        However in other locations, ShareTea still has one of the most unique combinations for milk teas as they had set the standard for other tea shops to follow. Though for the Davis location, try to steer clear of that place." style="width:100%;max-width:300px">
    <img id="myImg3" src="t4.png" alt="T4 by far has one of the biggest menus when milk tea and tea is concerned. They also sell slushies, smoothies, and other food options that customers can purchase. 
                                        T4 is for the common folk who are more interested in fruit teas." style="width:100%;max-width:300px;">
